            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>An easy way to get the calories and protein in that you need
                to fuel an athletic lifestyle. Can easily be modified to suit 
                your taste or macro-nutritional needs, however in general I try
                to aim for 750~ calories and around 50g of protein. Much more and 
                it starts to get hard to eat. You could simply eat one twice a day 
                if you were trying to bulk.
